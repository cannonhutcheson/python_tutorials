# python_tutorials
<p>
 python_tutorials is a repository that I have created in order to track my progress as I am learning and gaining expertise in different areas of the Python 3 programming 
language. All tutorials or projects that are in the repository are original. While some of them may use reference material (such as random data, etc.), none of the code that has been written has been taken from any other source.
